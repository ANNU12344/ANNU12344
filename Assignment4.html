			If you want to display static content, for example, a set of images, then HTML can do the job for you. 
			However, static pages are slowly becoming a thing of the past. 
			Most of the content today is interactive and includes flashy slideshows, forms, and menus. 
			They enhance user experience and add dynamicity to the website. 
			This is achieved by scripting languages and JavaScript is one of the most famous in this regard. 
			It lets developers make websites that interact with the user and vice versa. 
			Even though there are many other languages available, none of them is as popular as JavaScript. 
			In order to utilize it to the greatest potential, itâ€™s used in tandem with HTML.
